Exploring Color Palettes in RGB Space
=====================================

`/palette-sym` and `/palette` contain the images produced for Turk worker evaluation (generated from `heatmap.r()` on `mat.Rda` and `mat.sym.Rda`, respectively).
`/report` contains the code necessary for producing the HTML report including web graphics using `knitr`. Source `build.R` to run the entire build process including knitr and the insertion of WebGL graphics.
`/turk` contains the files sent to and generated by Amazon's mechanical turk.
`/ColorPalettes.csv` contains the Color Palettes downloaded from ColorBrewer.org
